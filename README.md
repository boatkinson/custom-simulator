# Custom Simulator
A custom simulator matching the requirements of the EWT Project to model subatomic behavior with classical physics. It provides a microscopic look at molecules, atoms, atomic nuclei, particles and spacetime, using the theoretical model from Energy Wave Theory (EWT).

## Getting Started
A developer has the flexibility to choose their platform of choice to build a simulation matching the requirements of the EWT Project.  The requirements and timeframe of project phases are outlined at http://www.energywavetheory.com/project.  The instructions for checking code into the project, including eligibility for the competition and prizes, are outlined at http://www.energywavetheory.com/project/competition-instructions.  

## Master Branch - Merged from Phase 1
The master branch includes code from Cristi Paun, winner of Phase 1.  It may be used by developers on future phases of this project.  

## Other Branches - Reference Examples
Two branches exist in this repository as other potential starting points for anyone developing a custom simulator:
* lori-gardi: Using CUDA, granule motion as waves are modeled using a spring-mass system. Developed by Lori Gardi.
* declan-traill: Using Delphi, electron and positron wave behavior is modeled. Developed by Declan Traill.
